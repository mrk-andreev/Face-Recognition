* train model on CE loss for classification task
* train model on ArcFace loss for classification task
* IR metric for both models and comparison similarity between faces on embeddings from models
* train model with face landmarks for face alignment
* faces detection and crop
* pipeline for faces recognition: detection -> alignment -> embeddings
